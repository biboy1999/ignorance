# Ignorance

Yet another OSINT Graph visualization and exploration Tool.

## Why reinvent wheel?

just maltego CE limits 12 results per transform.
and reinvent wheel is fun :).

## Feature
Web-based and local or online real-time collaboration(thanks to yjs).

  - Focus on collaboration.
  - Write your own transform.
      - classic API http post.
      - websocket real-time data. (TODO)
  - use your friends' transform.
  - It is open source :D
  
## Warning

Still in development, everything is likely to change in future updates and not be backward compatible.

Look out who collaborates with you.
  - Your shared transform can be attacked.
  - Transform(poorly made or active recon) can expose your identity or alert the target.
 
Use VM, VPN.
Sock pupprt account.
Collab with people you trust.

Stay safe.
